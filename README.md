The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways of the Government of India releases annual reports on road accidents and casualties in the country. Additionally, many state governments also release data on road accidents within their jurisdiction. There are many potential causes of road accidents, including: Distracted driving (e.g. using a cell phone, eating, or applying makeup while driving) Impaired driving (e.g. driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs) Reckless or aggressive driving (e.g. speeding, tailgating, or running red lights) Fatigue or drowsy driving Poor road conditions (e.g. potholes, debris, or lack of proper signage) Vehicle defects or malfunctions Poor weather conditions (e.g. rain, snow, or fog) Inadequate infrastructure (e.g. lack of proper lighting, median barriers, or guardrails) Pedestrian or bicycle errors Wildlife crossing the road. There are several datasets available on road accidents, depending on the country and region. Here are a few examples:

In the United States, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) provides data on vehicle crashes, including details such as the location, cause, and number of injuries and fatalities. The United Kingdom's Department for Transport provides data on reported road accidents, including information on the type of vehicle, number of casualties, and severity of injuries. The World Health Organization (WHO) also has a Global Status Report on Road Safety, which provides data on road accidents and fatalities for countries around the world. In India, the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) provides annual data on road accidents and fatalities. The Global Road Safety Partnership (GRSP) also has a wealth of data on road accidents and fatalities, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. It is important to note that these datasets may have different data collection methodologies, and may not include all road accidents that have occurred.
